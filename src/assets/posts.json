One massive change is the new colors and a more sleek appearance throughout the whole user interface, other than that and some minor changes and bug fixes, there isn't anything too big.

MacVG originally had dark blue for logo color, gold for accent color, random colors in random places, and neutral colors for background and elements. In this change, we unified the logo color and the accent color into this brand new vibrant orange color that guides you through the website. This makes your experience more unified, modern, and it's easier to distinguish between different MacWeb apps as they all got their own colors. Orange also asociates with excitement, fun, and vibrancy, which reflects what MacVG does: providing fun and exciting entertainment for you. We also changed element appearance including remade input fields that look more polished and more modern buttons. These design changes help with your experience and your eyes, making your game time at MacVG more comfortable üé®."

We've made 4 new repositories on GitHub: Action, Strategy, Driving, and Casual to host all the games. This effectivly cuts down the size of MacVG while still keeping all the games. This was the only way to deploy new updates to MacVG, so we're very sorry that this change reset all the progress on the games. This was the single biggest change to MacVG ever, so enjoy the new site üî•!"

We're also transitioning from an unblocked game site for school to an actual game platform for the general audience. Because of this, we removed the panic button as it's buggy and not many people actually use it. We also updated the Settings tab and its description.

First, we have the MacBlog Rebranding: New logo, appearance, and color. Originally, we used a dark blue color for logo, gold for accent, and a lot of other random colors, but in this update, we changed both the logo and accent color to purple, which doesn't only distinguish MacBlog from other MacWeb apps, it also makes your experiecne more clean, modern, organized, and comfortable. Purple also represents ambition, and MacBlog is a place where we share our \"ambitious\" plans and other info about MacWeb, making purple a perfect fit. We also added a collapsible help menu, feedback form, and other helpful resources about MacBlog, making its experience more unified with other MacWeb apps. We also fixed broken pages, navigation problems, styling issues, pages not showing, and project pages, removed the About tab because added a collapsible menu with that link. This unifies MacBlog experience with other MacWeb apps, removed outdated and unrelated information and content on MacBlog because of roadmap and project plan changes, removed and reorganized files and content, installed Google Analytics on every page for better user experience tracking, which helps us improve MacBlog. Finally, here's the future of MacBlog: we haven't really focused on working on MacBlog, as you can see, a lot of pages aren't working or lacking stuff and features that need to be fixed. In the next couple updates we'll hopefully be focusing on MacBlog's content, user interface, and features, making its quality better and more user friendly for everyone to see related information about MacWeb."

We had some rather ambitious plans of courses for MacLearn in the future, but because we're a small team and there's many other apps we're also actively working on, it's impossible to achieve these plans and complete the 20+ courses ranging from algebra to history. So we cancelled them. There's just not enoughh resources and time available, and it might not be worth it if we went all in and developed these courses. This is a loss on MacLearn's potential, but after the initial stages of MacLearn and after everything's done, fixed, and stabilized, and after we've grown enough, maybe there's a chance we'll bring some of these courses (or all of them) back in the future. For now, we've reduced the original planned 26 courses down to 3, focusing on our basic web development courses: HTML, CSS, and References. HTML is currently in beta testing, and CSS and References are still in development. We hope the reimagined and restructured MacLearn can be more focused on a few specific courses, bringing more educational resources to people interested in these topics. See you there üéí!"

Because of this change, when you're inputing the countdown date you have to write the date in this format: month/day.

To fix this, the navigation bar on the top auto adjusts its content, fitting all the links into one dropdown menu. If that's still too crowded, there's gonna be a button that expands the side menu for links. This update made the navigation and the experience using the app way more convenient, fast, cleaner, and easier on the eyes. The content also auto adjusts to fit the screen size and not waste any space or stretching out of the screen.

Using a Google form for download requests is slow, inefficient, and unprofessional. So, we've decided to remove the download button for all games that don't work and only keep it for games with a free distribution license that work on file protocol. This way, we tackle three big problems at once. We've also done away with the Google form and Google Drive setup. Instead, we‚Äôve zipped the folders (a smart and simple solution). Now, when users click the download button, the zipped folder will automatically download. They can then unzip it and enjoy the games offline, making sure they're playing copyright-free games without us having to process so many download requests."

The April update for MacVG was pretty big, so I copied the entire folder to the remote repository. But GitHub Desktop took forever to update and push it, causing the remote to disconnect multiple times. I had deleted all the files beforehand, so the game site was completely empty. I tried a lot of solutions, and nothing worked until I realized that GitHub Desktop only pushes the changed files each time. So, I divided the MacVG folder into smaller sections and uploaded each section one by one. It took a long time, but I gradually uploaded 30 games at a time, then 40, then 50, repeating until all the games and other files were uploaded to the remote repository. That's how we fixed this huge MacVG issue in just 2 hours. Let's go!"

The experience was terrible. While working on the July update, we went through the JavaScript files to optimize and improve performance. We checked each code and found an event listener that was preventing the keydown event‚Äôs default actions, meaning you couldn‚Äôt type in games. We have no idea why that piece of code was there, but after removing it, the bug was finally fixed! Now you can type in so many games. Thanks to your feedback, we identified and resolved this issue! This fix didn‚Äôt have any negative impact, so you can now enjoy tons of games like the Vex series, Google Feud, Mario, Minecraft, and more, which you couldn't play before due to the annoying bug!"

I logged onto ChatGPT and asked for help on how to use GitHub Desktop since I wanted to use it for uploading stuff. After watching a bunch of YouTube tutorials that didn't really help, I finally found one that did and managed to upload \"10 Minutes Till Dawn\" to GitHub via GitHub Desktop. Then, I did some more research, changed my global identity settings, and downloaded Git. Finally, I went into the settings (Files -> Options) and disabled SSH, and it worked successfully!"

With the new 2.0 update, we introduced a brand-new UI for each game page and updated URLs and links for each game. At first, we placed the game HTML files with the new UI outside the original parent folder for the games. This caused local storage access issues due to browser cross-origin problems, resulting in game progress resets. So, we moved the refreshed HTML files inside the games' folders to avoid cross-origin issues and make sure your progress is saved. Thanks to this change, your game progress is safe and sound. Enjoy your uninterrupted gaming experience!"

Because we're switching to a new technology to build our apps, we also need to recode all the existing features and programs from scratch, so this will be an extremely big and large-scale update across our apps.

We're rolling out a new navigation bar with the logo and the tabs, as well as 2 new buttons: light mode toggle and view source. The light mode button toggles between light and dark modes, providing more customization and accessbility for all kinds of needs on our apps. All of our apps are open source on GitHub, so users can click on the view source button to check our code and even provide contribution/suggestions.

In a few years, it's possible we'll continue development, but for now they will not be updated. This doesn't mean they will be shut down, they will still be accessible and work perfectly fine, but they won't be receiving new features, fixes, or changes in a long time. Because we're only focusing on MacVG and MacLearn right now, we're also removing some integration of the apps such as the old MacWeb sidebar used for accessing other MacWeb apps. This kind of breaks the old \"ecosystem\" we had, and our apps are kind of distinct standalone apps now.
